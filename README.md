## Introduction

[MonacoFX](https://github.com/miho/MonacoFX) is a powerful editor node for JavaFX. It is based on [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), the code editor that drives [VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).

It uses the JavaFX WebView node to integrate Monaco into the scene graph. Additionally, it provides a Java API for adding custom languages, code folding and themes. Changing properties, like text and scroll position, are represented as regular JavaFX properties. The correspoonding callbacks into JS are added by [MonacoFX](https://github.com/miho/MonacoFX).
